  Project - Libft :books:
</h1>

The goal of this project is to create a personal C library, named "libft," which will contain essential general-purpose functions to be used in future C projects. It involves replicating a set of standard C library functions (libc) under new names and adding additional helpful functions. The project must adhere to strict guidelines, including memory management, norm compliance, and specific Makefile rules. Bonus points can be earned by implementing extra features, such as list manipulation, but only if the mandatory part is completed perfectly. The final submission is evaluated through peer review and automated testing
